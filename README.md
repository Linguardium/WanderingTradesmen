# WanderingTradesmen 2.0
Adds a json configurable wandering trader style event.
Allows any number of wandering trader types.


TODO:
ultimately the plan is to move to JSON files. I will be looking into implementing a similar style to https://github.com/FVbico/Data-Driven-Minecraft or the bedrock behavior pack formats. More info to come.  (data driven is life)

Recreate everything
Look into server-only implementations
JSON loading
Re-implement LibCD after json data functions are stabilized
